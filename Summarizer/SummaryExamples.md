Original Text(2): Good value for a lot of treats! my dog absolutely loves these and it's awesome that they sell them on amazon for half the price of what they would sell it for at a pet store! Will continue buying from here as long as they're available :)

Original Text(3): My baby seems to prefer this formula mixture over the other bigger brands. If you buy it "Subscribe and Save" it's a lot cheaper, which is nice. I breastfed for 9 months until my baby stopped gaining weight so we had to start giving her formula. She's been growing steadily ever since!
Original summary(3): Seems healthy, and my baby prefers it
My Summary(3): great formula for baby

Original Text(4): These are so good, especially when they are still hot. I love the way they still sizzle and pop while eating. Sometimes I sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese, depending on my mood. However I eat them, they are really good. Remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them. The bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn, so don't expect them to. Only cook for the suggested time on the bag.
Original summary(4): Yummmy!
My Summary(4) : good stuff

Original Text(7): When I was growing up, we ate a fair amount of Spam. Every so often, I revisit those days, by purchasing some Spam and trying to enjoy it. And I think of the old Monty Python segment focusing on Spam. . . .

It's not so easy for me to enjoy! Plain Spam, even cooked, doesn't do it for me. I start out with good intentions of eating it as part of a meal and normally throw quite a bit of it out. So, this time around, I tried something different--a fried Spam sandwich.

I cut up and fried some shallots, slathered a couple pieces of bread with Dijon mustard and catsup, and melted some American cheese over the Spam. And it worked! This time, I successfully fixed something that didn't feature the Spam taste. The result was an enjoyable sandwich.

So, instead of throwing out all the Spam (as has happened in the past), I'm going to use my imagination this time in preparing this for a meal. In the past, this would have rated 1 to 2 stars; this time around, I'll give it three.
Original summary(7): Back to the future with Spam
Response Words(7): not the best

Original Text(10): Got some matcha in Japan from the airport and it was surprisingly tasty. Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out. So, with matcha it's just gonna happen, since you can't take out the tea bag.

That said, the Japan matcha was more granular than a "powder", more like sand really, and did not produce much bitterness even after ten minutes in hot water. This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder. It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.

UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had. The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further. To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings. I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously. Using the smaller amount, it works great for hot tea and does not become bitter.
Original summary(10): Price is OK, flavor a bit bitter
Response Words(10): not as good as i hoped

Original Tex(11)t: Oh, this is some good cat food!
Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?
This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good.
Original summary(11): Exceptional Cat Food!
Response Words(11): smells good

Original Text(12): Hmm, at first, I thought this was another one of those beverages competing with Red Bull. However, as soon as I had my first sip, I knew I was in for something healthier.

Hmmm...healthy vs. energy boost? That is the question of the day.

The Switch contains 100% fruit juice and none of the other stuff. It's just carbonated juice.

However, I didn't really quite catch that 'black cherry' flavor. It tasted more like apple juice than anything else. Nonetheless, it was still good!
Original summary(12): carbonated juice
Response Words(12): not like cherry
