# Multi Office Summarizer
An abstractive summarizer for office needs
It is used to summarise meetings by converting speech to text. The text file is then sent to the summariser to generate a summary. We have also built an optical charcter recognition system so that we can extract text data from pdf and convert it to a txt file and this txt file will also be fed to the summarizer.

# Challenges we ran into
